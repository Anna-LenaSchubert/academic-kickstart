# About Me

I'm working as a postdoc at the Section of Personality Research at Heidelberg University, Germany, where I try to identify the neuro-cognitive mechanisms underlying individual differences in general intelligence. In particular, I am investigating how interactions between cognitive processes such as mental speed, attention, executive functions, and working memory give rise to individual differences in intelligence.

To achieve this goal, I employ a variety of neuro-cognitive methods. I use an experimental approach to determine how experimental or pharmaceutical manipulations of specific processes affect cognitive functions and general intelligence. Moreover, I use neurophysiological methods to study the biological basis of mental abilities. Most frequently, I study brain activity with the electroencephalogram (EEG), which gives me detailed information about the ongoing stream of neural information processing. Finally, I employ mathematical models of cognition to identify process parameters differing between individuals.
